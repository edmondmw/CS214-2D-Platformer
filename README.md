A 2D platformer created for CS214 Unity in C# Programming class at City College of San Francisco. 

The first level is a simple platforming level that follows the 2D platformer tutorial on Unity's website pretty closely, along with a few modifications for improved efficiency.

The second level involves wall jumping while avoiding rising lava and falling meteors. This was created to learn about wall jumping implementation and scrolling backgrounds.

The third level involves parallax scrolling and a more efficient method of scrolling the background. Whereas the previous level would generate new tiles to scroll forwards, this level cycles the same three tiles. It also involves a bazooka and simple alien enemies. The enemy AI is fairly simple and just moves towards the player position. This level is a bit buggy with enemies occasionally falling off the map or spawning too close to the player. This is due to the scrolling nature of the background tiles, I'll have to learn how to get around this issue in future projects.
